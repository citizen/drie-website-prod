    <h1>INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY IS OUR PASSION</h1>
     <p>The drie team has over 20 years of experience building infrastructure platforms. Before starting drie, the core team developed platform as a service (PaaS) for a UK government department.</p>

<p>That's when we realised that we could build a cloud platform that meets the security needs of large organisations whilst being easy to use and cost effective at the same time. We've taken what we learned from building reliable, highly available and accredited cloud infrastructures across the energy, gaming, government and biotech sectors and brought that to drie, to make it easy for anyone to run their software securely in the cloud.</p>

<p>drie is web application platform that glues together the best bits of Amazon Web Services (AWS). We use AWS security best practice to implement a repeatable, effective baseline security for our customers across FinTech, HealthTech and the Government.</p>
